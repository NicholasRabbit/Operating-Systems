### Operating-Systems

When it comes to operating systems, if my memory serves, I was interested in Linux after reading an essay about Linux. It was described as a powerful operating system which can do everything like Windows OS does and is free of charge. Unfortunately, I didn't delve into it after failing to install an Linux OS on my PC. But the freedom to use an OS mentioned in the essay was impressive. 

However, as it said in online community, Linux is free only if your time is free. It is a so sophisticated system that is not easy to control. After being a software engineer for about three years, I still don't master Linux except for some basic shell commands, or using Vim. 

Presumably, it is not the right way to learn about Linux to search answers of errors of the system until midnights. I should learn from the basic level, the low level. Almost all the operating systems share the designing principle as same as Unix. As a middle-aged person, time is precious to me so it's better to start it now before it is too late.
